    <h2>Cleo</h2>
    <p>Cleo is my black cat and she is 2 and a half years old.  She enjoys playing in cardboard boxes, and jumping in plastic bags. She also enjoys snuggling and giving kisses!</p>
    <p>Some cultures believe that black cats are bad luck and they have a harder time getting adopted from shelters. In other cultures, they find black cats to be good luck!</p>

    <blockquote>
      <i>"Black cats have been found to have lower odds of adoption in American shelters compared to other colors except brown, although black animals in general take more time to find homes."</i>
